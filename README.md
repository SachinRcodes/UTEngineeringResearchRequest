# UTEngineeringResearchRequest
Creates a database of all faculty on the Cockrell School of Engineering page and creates a draft of an email to send to them

To use, get all 3 files, modify the sender email and password  in emailSender.py, and the template in main.py

If using with Gmail, you may have to create an app password to do so, enable 2FA and go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

NOTE: This is currently structured to work with the Cockrell School of Engineering; it may not work elsewhere Additionally this program creates drafts instead of sending emails.
